# Challenge
In our daily lives, whether we're shopping online, ordering food, or using various services, transactions are a constant. And there's something almost as common as these transactions themselves: reward programs. These programs are everywhere – from your credit card offering cashback, to your favorite clothing store giving points for every purchase, or even the food delivery app that surprises you with a discount on your next order. These rewards make spending money feel a bit more worthwhile, adding a touch of excitement and appreciation to the otherwise mundane act of making a purchase.

Despite the digital world advancing rapidly, there's a gap in the blockchain space. Traditional reward systems haven't quite caught up in this new era of technology. People are engaging more and more with digital currencies and blockchain transactions, yet the familiar and enticing concept of rewards is often missing. This disconnect means many potential users, familiar with the perks of traditional reward systems, might hesitate to dive into the blockchain world, missing out on its benefits and innovations.

# Solution
In this bootcamp, our app's purpose is simple yet powerful: it enables any company, protocol, or organization to easily sign up and integrate their own ERC20 token as a reward mechanism. This integration is designed to be seamless, efficient, and adaptable to a variety of business models.

### How It Works:
**Flexibility for Companies**: Whether it's a web3 gaming company, a service provider, bootcamp, or a tech firm, any business can join our platform. They can choose their own ERC20 token to use as a reward. This could be an existing token they have or a new one created specifically for this purpose.

**Rewarding Transactions:** The magic happens during transactions. Whenever a registered company makes or receives a payment through our app, the other party involved in the transaction – be it a customer, a client, or a service provider – automatically receives a specified amount of the company's ERC20 token as a reward.

**User Engagement:** These rewards add an extra layer of engagement and value to every transaction. It's not just about the exchange of goods or services anymore; it's also about earning something extra that can have its own unique benefits.

# Why it Matters
This app simplifies blockchain transactions and introduces rewarding experiences, making digital currencies more accessible and appealing to a wider audience. It's about building trust and loyalty in the blockchain world, bridging gaps between technology and user benefits.

# Use Cases

## Web3 Gaming Company
**Rewarding Player Engagement:** A Web3 gaming company uses our app to enhance player experience. Each in-game purchase or achievement is rewarded with the company's ERC20 tokens. These tokens could be used for exclusive content, in-game upgrades, or special events access, significantly boosting player engagement and loyalty to the game.

## Company Salaries
**Incentivizing Employees with Rewards:** A company decides to use our app for salary disbursement. Along with their usual salary in a stablecoin like USDC, employees receive additional ERC20 tokens from the company. These tokens can serve as bonuses, savings plans, or special privileges within the company, enhancing employee satisfaction and retention.

## E-commerce
**Enhancing Shopping Experience:** An e-commerce platform integrates our app to offer a unique shopping experience. Customers receive ERC20 tokens as rewards for every purchase, which can be used for discounts, free shipping, or exclusive product access on future purchases. This approach not only incentivizes repeat business but also fosters a stronger customer-brand relationship.
